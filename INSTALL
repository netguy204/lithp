INSTALLING (dunno why you'd want to do this)

cp test_parser /usr/bin

RUNNING

./test_parser test.l  (to run the demo)
./test_parser (to read code from stdin, CTRL+D CTRL+D to end and
execute)

DEMO FILES

test.l    - add stuff, define functions, show off map

t3.l      - much cooler map demonstrations... shows off how expressive the
            language can be

lettest.l - bunch of stuff that doesn't work because of the way
            variables are scoped in this language

t2.l      - code that doesn't work because lettest.l doesn't work. I'll
            be adding a primitive to override scope so that functions like 
            the ones in lettest.l can be defined
